        <h3>JaCoCo Code Coverage Reports</h3>
        <p>These reports are generated using JaCoCo, and show the overall test coverage through all execution paths.</p>
        <p>Code Coverage initially decreased as the project grew faster than we wrote tests, however has increased
           since implementing our full set of unit tests. Most of the missed code requires manual testing as it is involved with 
        processes such as rendering that are difficult to test automatically.</p>
        <h4>Initial Code Coverage shortly after setting up JaCoCo.</h4>

        <h3>Checkstyle Code Quality Reports</h3>
        <p>
            These reports are generated using checkstyle and show any formatting issues present in the code.
            In the second report we have achieved an average of around one issue per file, with no warnings
            or errors present.
